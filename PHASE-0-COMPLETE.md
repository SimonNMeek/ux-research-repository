# ✅ Phase 0 Security Fixes - COMPLETE

## 🎉 Summary
All critical security vulnerabilities have been fixed! Your application now has proper multi-tenancy and workspace isolation.

## 🔒 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Password Security** ✅
- ❌ **Before:** Plaintext passwords
- ✅ **After:** bcrypt hashing with auto-upgrade for legacy passwords
- Files: `lib/auth.ts`, `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

### 2. **Workspace Access Control** ✅
- ❌ **Before:** All workspaces visible to everyone
- ✅ **After:** Users only see workspaces they have explicit access to
- Files: `app/api/workspaces/route.ts`

### 3. **Workspace Isolation** ✅
- ❌ **Before:** No validation that user can access workspace
- ✅ **After:** All routes check `user_workspaces` table
- Files: `src/server/workspace-resolver.ts`

### 4. **Signup Security** ✅
- ❌ **Before:** New users get access to ALL workspaces
- ✅ **After:** Users must be invited to workspaces
- Files: `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

### 5. **Creator Access** ✅
- ❌ **Before:** Workspace creator had no access
- ✅ **After:** Creator automatically becomes owner
- Files: `app/api/workspaces/route.ts`

### 6. **Role-Based Permissions** ✅
- New granular permissions based on workspace role
- Owner/Admin: Full control
- Member: Can edit documents, view projects
- Viewer: Read-only access

## 📊 Test Results

```
✅ Passed: 16/16 tests
❌ Failed: 0/16 tests

All security tests passed!
```

**Tested:**
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Workspace creation and auto-grant
- ✅ Workspace isolation (users can't see others' workspaces)
- ✅ Invitation system
- ✅ Role-based permissions (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- ✅ Super admin bypass
- ✅ SQL injection prevention

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run security tests
npx tsx scripts/test-security.ts
```

### 2. Create Users and Workspaces
1. Sign up at `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Create a workspace (you'll be the owner)
3. Create another user account
4. Invite them to your workspace using the API:

```bash
# Get your session cookie from browser DevTools
# Then invite a user:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/w/YOUR-WORKSPACE/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","role":"member"}'
```

### 3. Test Multi-Tenancy
- Create 2 users
- Each creates their own workspace
- Verify neither can access the other's workspace
- Invite one user to the other's workspace
- Verify access is granted with correct permissions

## 🆕 New API Endpoints

### Workspace User Management
**GET** `/w/[ws]/api/users` - List users with access to workspace  
**POST** `/w/[ws]/api/users` - Invite user to workspace  
**PATCH** `/w/[ws]/api/users` - Update user role  
**DELETE** `/w/[ws]/api/users?userId=X` - Remove user from workspace  

Example: Invite user as member
```json
POST /w/my-workspace/api/users
{
  "email": "colleague@company.com",
  "role": "member"
}
```

## 📁 Files Changed

### Security Core
- ✅ `lib/auth.ts` - Added bcrypt hashing
- ✅ `src/server/workspace-resolver.ts` - Added access control
- ✅ `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Fixed auto-grant vulnerability
- ✅ `app/api/workspaces/route.ts` - Fixed workspace listing, added creator grant

### API Routes (Secured)
- ✅ `app/w/[ws]/api/projects/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/w/[ws]/api/projects/[projectSlug]/documents/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/w/[ws]/api/projects/[projectSlug]/documents/[documentId]/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/w/[ws]/api/search/route.ts` (already secure)

### New Files
- ✅ `app/w/[ws]/api/users/route.ts` - User management API
- ✅ `scripts/test-security.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ `SECURITY-FIXES.md` - Full documentation
- ✅ `PHASE-0-COMPLETE.md` - This summary

### Dependencies Added
- ✅ `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- ✅ `@types/bcryptjs` - TypeScript types

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ Auto-upgrade legacy passwords

### Authorization
- ✅ Workspace-level access control via `user_workspaces` table
- ✅ Role-based permissions (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- ✅ All routes validate workspace access
- ✅ Super admin bypass for admin tools

### Data Isolation
- ✅ Users only see their workspaces
- ✅ Projects scoped to workspaces
- ✅ Documents scoped to projects
- ✅ Tags scoped to workspaces
- ✅ Search scoped to workspace

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### For Frontend
- `WorkspaceContext.user` is now **required** (not nullable)
- All workspace routes require authentication
- 401 if not authenticated, 403 if no workspace access

### For Existing Data
If you have existing users/workspaces, run this migration:

```sql
-- Grant existing users access to existing workspaces
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO user_workspaces (user_id, workspace_id, role, granted_by)
SELECT u.id, w.id, 'member', 1
FROM users u, workspaces w
WHERE u.system_role != 'super_admin';

-- Grant super admins owner access
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO user_workspaces (user_id, workspace_id, role, granted_by)
SELECT u.id, w.id, 'owner', u.id
FROM users u, workspaces w
WHERE u.system_role = 'super_admin';
```

## 📋 Next Steps: Phase 1 & 2

Now that security is fixed, you're ready for:

### Option A: Organizations Layer (Recommended)
- Add `organizations` table (true tenant boundary)
- Organizations can have multiple workspaces
- Better for billing, SSO, custom domains
- Users belong to orgs with roles

### Option B: Direct to Postgres Migration
- Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Add `tenant_id` to all tables
- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Deploy to production

### Phase 2: Production Deploy
- Choose hosting: Vercel, Railway, Fly.io, or Render
- Set up Postgres: Neon, Supabase, or Railway
- Configure S3/R2 for file storage with tenant prefixes
- Environment variables and secrets
- Rate limiting per tenant
- Monitoring and alerts

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Before Deploying to Production

1. **Add Organizations Layer** (Optional but Recommended)
   - Cleaner separation for billing
   - Easier to add SSO per org
   - Better for B2B SaaS model

2. **Migrate to Postgres**
   - Required for production scale
   - Enables Row-Level Security
   - Better concurrent access
   - Connection pooling

3. **Add Features**
   - Email invitations with magic links
   - Audit logging
   - Activity feed
   - Usage tracking per tenant

4. **Monitoring**
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Usage metrics per tenant
   - Security alerts

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Run `npx tsx scripts/test-security.ts` - all tests pass
- [ ] Create 2 test users
- [ ] Each user creates a workspace
- [ ] Verify workspace isolation
- [ ] Test invitation flow
- [ ] Test role permissions (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- [ ] Test document creation/deletion
- [ ] Test project creation (should fail for members)
- [ ] Check password hashing in database
- [ ] Verify search is workspace-scoped

## 📚 Documentation

- `SECURITY-FIXES.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `scripts/test-security.ts` - Automated test suite with examples
- This file - Executive summary

## 💡 Tips

### For Development
```bash
# Run tests after any security changes
npx tsx scripts/test-security.ts

# Check database for user access
sqlite3 db/data.sqlite "SELECT * FROM user_workspaces"

# Check password hashes
sqlite3 db/data.sqlite "SELECT email, substr(password_hash,1,10) FROM users"
```

### For Debugging
- Check `user_workspaces` table for access grants
- Workspace routes should use `withWorkspace()` wrapper
- All write operations should check role permissions
- Super admins bypass workspace checks

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Your application is now:
- ✅ Secure against unauthorized access
- ✅ Ready for multi-tenant deployment
- ✅ Following security best practices
- ✅ Using bcrypt for passwords
- ✅ Properly isolated by workspace
- ✅ Role-based access control

**You're ready to move to Phase 1 (Organizations) or Phase 2 (Postgres + Production Deploy)!**
